    <h3>How to prepare the melt</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Place tuna into a mixing bowl and lightly break it apart with a fork. Add celery, green onion, capers, mayonnaise, and chile paste. <br>
            Pinch in small pieces mozzarella and stir to mix. Season with salt and black pepper; refrigerate tuna salad until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread butter generously on both sides of French bread slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil buttered bread until golden brown on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip bread slices and broil other side until toasted, 2 to 3 more minutes.<br>
            Remove from the oven and turn bread slices over on the baking sheet so the darkest sides are on the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently spread tuna salad onto bread slices using 2 forks. Press the salad onto the bread and spread tuna all the way to the edges of the bread.<br>
            Spread shredded Cheddar over each sandwich. Dust tops with cayenne pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place sandwiches under the broiler and cook until cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 to 6 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
